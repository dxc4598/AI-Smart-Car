## 1. Project Aim


## 2. Project Description
Our theme is smart cars, which use C++as the main programming language to write driver and logic control programs, allowing the car to judge its environment based on the data collected by sensors and make the expected behavior according to algorithms.

## 3. Functions
- basic movements(forward, backward, turn)
- obstacle detection and avoidance
- Obstacle scanning
- navigation extraction
- buzzer reminder

## 4. Experiments and Testing
#### 4.1. obstacle avoidance
![obstacle avoidance]()
Place the car on a designated route, place some obstacles along the route, and control the car to follow the route. It can be observed that the car can scan for obstacles and avoid them while driving. At the same time, it can also be set to drive left and automatically avoid obstacles.

#### 4.2. obstacle scanning
![obstacle scanning]()
We placed many obstacles in a space, and the vehicle executed scanning and monitoring commands. The motor drove the ultrasonic sensor to rotate and scan, and obstacles were found. In addition, for moving object monitoring, we quickly blocked the sensor with our hands and observed the sensor monitoring results.

## 5. value in reality
With the development of automobiles in the field of intelligence, drivers' operations have become increasingly simple, and various autonomous driving functions have provided convenience for people's lives. In the future, cars will no longer even need the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes. 
The function we developed is also based on the above concept. Through Google Maps, we can drive the car from point a to point b. If the accuracy of the map is high enough, theoretically it can achieve level 5 autonomous driving in cities. On the other hand, for some special road conditions, such as pedestrian crossings, roadblocks, and some unexpected situations, our developed ultrasonic ranging function can also monitor obstacles in front of the vehicle in real-time, allowing the car to slow down or avoid them in advance. 
In addition, we also considered the situation of lane intrusion. When vehicles or obstacles invade the driving lane, our developed function can avoid or stop based on the proportion of obstacles occupied. This function can be applied to some special vehicles, such as road cleaning vehicles.
